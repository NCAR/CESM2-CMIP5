Comparing namelists for CESM1, CESM2 and CESM2-CMIP5 experiments
================================================================

To obtain the namelists of the CESM1, CESM2 and CESM2-CMIP5 experiments, you need to do the following ::

      git clone https://github.com/NCAR/CESM2-CMIP5  --branch namelists  namelists
      
This command will create a directory called ``namelists`` that contains all the CESM1, CESM2 and CESM2-CMIP5 namelists for each compset B1850, BHIST and RCP85.
